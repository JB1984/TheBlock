# TheBlock
TheBlock is an attempt to create a decentralized twitter like social media platform, written in Python using Flask. TheBlock is a work in progress. Many features to still add. 

<b> Most recent update in branch Version 0.8 on 9/16/2018</b> Added automatic port forwarding using UPnP library. Right now set to port 5001

<i>Merged</i> <b>Most recent update 0.7 done on 9/14/2018</b> Changed flash host to "0.0.0.0" to allow for outside connections.

<i>Merged</i> <b>update 0.6 done on 9/1/2018</b> changed a lot of code related to the look of posts and how images show in each post.

To use this just clone the repo and use a CLI:

"python blockchain.py -p 5000"

"python blockchain_client.py -p 8080"

navigate to the approriate localhost addresses in your browser and have some fun. 

To use first create a wallet and then mess around with sending transactions. Use different ports on your computer to simulate multiple nodes on the network. 

You will need to have the python packages listed at the end of this document to run the program.

Slowly but surely adding features and learning new skills to make this project a reality.
